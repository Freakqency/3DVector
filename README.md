# 3D Vector class


This is an implementation of 3d vector class for c++ language

# Operations

  - Scalar Addition
  - Scalar Subtraction
  - Scalar Multiplication
  - Scalar Division
  - Dot Product
  - Cross Product
  - Normalization
  - Square
  - Magnitude

### Compilation and execution
```bash
g++ 3dvector.cpp -o 3dvector.out
./3dvector.out
```
### Design Choices
- Efficient 3dvector declaration
- Operator overloading for user convinience
- Print function to print the computed values
- No Inheritance is required since no extra classs is used
